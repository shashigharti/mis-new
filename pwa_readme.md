# **PWA steps for testing:**
1. Go the form page once, the service worker will cache all the assets and files needed for offline usage,
2. Go into `Chrome Dev tools > Application > Service Workers (Left Menu) > Check Offline`, and refresh the page
3. Fill in the form and submit, 
4. To check form data in IndexedDb, Go into `Chrome Dev tools > IndexedDB (Storage Section) > mis_surveys object store`, Here we can see that the key is getting autogenerated by the indexed db api and values contains the list of form values, 
5. Get back online by un checking the offline checkbox at `Chrome Dev tools > Application > Service Workers (Left Menu) > Offline`, and refresh the page, 
6. On `phpmyadmin > dynform_datas`, we can check the updated data.
